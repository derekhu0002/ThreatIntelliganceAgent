# Argo Copilot Instructions

## Purpose

These instructions apply to the main Copilot agent for this repository.
The goal is to keep a stable shared understanding of how to read intent architecture, implementation architecture, and code without requiring the user to restate those rules in each task.

## Repository Reading Order

When a task concerns architecture, implementation, tests, delivery, or code changes, follow this order unless the user explicitly narrows scope:

1. Read `design/KG/SystemArchitecture.json` first.
  Read it as an intent-architecture knowledge graph, not as a static checklist: inspect relevant elements, relationships, views, attributes, and testcase-related fields before moving on.
2. Then read the repository root implementation architecture contract in `OVERALL_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
3. Then read relevant local `ARCHITECTURE.md` files under affected stable directories.
4. Only after those contracts are read, inspect code, tests, scripts, configuration, and documentation as implementation evidence.

Do not ask the user for facts that can be confirmed from the repository, contracts, tests, or tool results.

## Graph Usage Protocol

For `design/KG/SystemArchitecture.json`:
1. Use the graph as the first fact source, read it as modeled architecture rather than informal prose, and preserve ArchiMate semantics instead of rewriting them by naming intuition.
2. Treat `attributes`, `description`, `browser_path`, `acceptanceCriteria`, `#file:...`, and `#sym:...` as evidence pointers; follow them on demand, but do not let referenced evidence override explicit graph semantics.
3. Treat explicit testcase baselines as stable acceptance boundaries unless the user is explicitly redesigning intent architecture; do not add, delete, rebuild, or redefine them during ordinary implementation or repair work.
4. Keep stage boundaries explicit: intent design updates intent, implementation architecture design updates contracts and testcase ownership, coding updates implementation only, and support tests or runtime notes belong in implementation assets rather than the intent layer.
5. Do not conclude from isolated names or descriptions; use nearby relationships, views, upstream and downstream context, and referenced evidence together, make only minimal assumptions, and clearly separate repository-confirmed facts from assumptions in the final explanation.
6. Treat `.github/argoschema/SystemArchitecture.schema.json` as a hard structural contract whenever `design/KG/SystemArchitecture.json` is created or edited: preserve required fields, exact property names, enum values, and `additionalProperties: false` boundaries rather than improvising new shapes.
7. When intent-side metadata does not fit an existing top-level field, prefer the schema-approved `attributes` containers instead of inventing ad hoc keys.

## Architecture Layers

### Intent Architecture

- `design/KG/SystemArchitecture.json` is the first source of truth for intent, constraints, explicit semantics, and acceptance boundaries.
- The intent graph is an architecture skeleton suitable for loading into agent context; detailed expansion should live in repository files referenced from the graph rather than being invented ad hoc.
- The intent model is the ontology container for intent-side concepts, design elements, their relationships, and explicit testcase baselines.
- Treat explicit testcase definitions in the intent architecture as acceptance baseline contracts.
- Explicit testcases belong to the intent layer and form part of the acceptance boundary; they are not implementation details.
- Treat principles and constraints in the intent architecture as stronger than current code reality.
- Current code does not override the intent architecture automatically.
- Interpret ArchiMate element and relationship semantics according to the modeling language, not by informal name guessing.
- Intent defines what must be true, including explicit acceptance boundaries that downstream layers are expected to fulfill rather than reinterpret.
- Any edit to `design/KG/SystemArchitecture.json` must also satisfy `.github/argoschema/SystemArchitecture.schema.json`; schema compliance is part of correctness, not optional cleanup.

### Implementation Architecture

- Implementation architecture is not a separate abstract idea; it is expressed by the repository itself.
- The implementation model is the ontology container for implementation-side concepts, stable architecture elements, testcase ownership, and guardrail structure.
- The root contract is `OVERALL_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Local contracts are the relevant `ARCHITECTURE.md` files inside stable directories.
- Stable directory and file layout, explicit testcase entrypoints, and non-explicit test guardrails are part of the implementation architecture.
- A directory is considered a **Stable Architecture Element** if it contains an `ARCHITECTURE.md` or is explicitly mapped in `OVERALL_ARCHITECTURE.md`. If neither exists, treat it as an incidental implementation detail.
- Stable architecture elements and their relations should be materialized by stable repository directories and their contracts; they are not inferred from arbitrary files by default.
- The implementation side owns executable guards, test entrypoints, and the physical organization of supporting validation assets.
- The repository root is the read boundary of implementation architecture; stable directories and key files are implementation elements only when contracts promote them to that role.
- Directory hierarchy means containment by default, not automatic `implements` semantics.
- `implements` mappings must be declared explicitly in `OVERALL_ARCHITECTURE.md` and relevant `ARCHITECTURE.md` files.
- Indirect implementation chains are valid. If element C implements element B, and B implements intent element A, then C indirectly carries A.
- Implementation architecture organizes and constrains realization: it turns intent into stable elements, dependency direction, testcase ownership, and executable guardrails.

### Code Reality

- Code, tests, scripts, and configuration are evidence of the current implementation state.
- Code realization is the executed and editable implementation state that consumes and realizes the implementation architecture; it is not the same thing as the architecture contract itself.
- They help confirm or reject hypotheses about the implementation, but they do not silently redefine intent architecture or frozen architecture contracts.
- When code conflicts with established architecture contracts, report the mismatch and prefer restoring alignment rather than normalizing drift.
- Code realizes the implementation architecture. Treat the overall flow as directional: intent drives implementation architecture, implementation architecture governs coding, and divergence between code and architecture is drift unless the user is intentionally redesigning the upstream layers.

## Graph Interpretation Rules

For `design/KG/SystemArchitecture.json`:
- Treat `attributes`, `description`, `browser_path`, `acceptanceCriteria`, `#file:...`, and `#sym:...` as traceability and evidence pointers.
- Follow those pointers to gather evidence, but do not let referenced content override explicit graph semantics, principles, constraints, or testcase baselines.
- Read relationships directionally and preserve their source/target semantics; do not flatten them into undirected associations.
- When graph information is incomplete, make only the minimum necessary assumption, label it clearly as an assumption, and avoid inventing external interfaces, deployment facts, SLAs, org processes, or new acceptance baselines.
- When graph statements and code disagree, prefer the graph and contracts first, then explain the implementation drift.
- If a proposed graph edit would require fields, object shapes, or property names that the schema does not allow, stop and redesign the representation using schema-approved structures instead of forcing the JSON.

## Conflict Priority

When repository evidence conflicts, resolve it in this order:

1. Hard constraints and principles in the intent architecture.
2. Explicit testcase baselines and explicit intent semantics.
3. Clear graph content in elements, relationships, views, and attributes.
4. Referenced files and symbols followed from graph pointers.
5. Current code reality.

## Stage Boundaries

### Intent Architecture Design Stage

- Responsible for intent elements, relationships, views, principles, constraints, and explicit testcase baselines.
- Do not rewrite intent baselines during ordinary implementation or coding tasks unless the user explicitly requests intent redesign.
- When this stage edits `design/KG/SystemArchitecture.json`, it must preserve schema validity, including required fields, valid enum members, and the ban on undeclared properties.
- Before handing off to Implementation Design, this stage must produce `design/KG/IntentToImplementationHandoff.json` that satisfies `.github/argoschema/IntentToImplementationHandoff.schema.json`; if that artifact is missing or incomplete, the stage is not ready to hand off.

### Implementation Architecture Design Stage

- Responsible for `OVERALL_ARCHITECTURE.md`, relevant `ARCHITECTURE.md`, stable implementation boundaries, explicit testcase entrypoint materialization, and critical non-explicit tests.
- Focus on high-level stable elements such as stable directories, stable components, key entry files, interface boundaries, dependency direction, test ownership, and traceability.
- Do not degrade into file-by-file or function-by-function mirroring.
- This stage converts intent-side explicit testcases into physical read-only entrypoints plus critical and supporting non-explicit test guardrails in the repository.
- This stage must generate executable testcase assets that are intentionally allowed and, when implementation is still missing, expected to fail for the right reason; these expected-failing results are a required handoff input to the Coding/Repair stage rather than a sign that implementation design is incomplete.
- When designing any testcase in this stage, explicitly record the testcase control point and observation point alongside its ownership, entrypoint, and guardrail role.
- Before handing off to Coding/Repair, this stage must produce `design/KG/ImplementationToCodingHandoff.json` that satisfies `.github/argoschema/ImplementationToCodingHandoff.schema.json`; that artifact must reference the concrete contracts, testcase entrypoints, frozen files, and expected failure signals that Coding/Repair is required to consume.

### Coding And Repair Stage

- Respect the frozen and evolvable test assets defined in Test Semantics and in the implementation contracts.
- Treat expected-failing testcase assets produced during implementation architecture design as the primary repair queue: coding work should make those existing tests pass by completing or repairing implementation, not by weakening or redesigning the tests.
- Read `design/KG/ImplementationToCodingHandoff.json` before changing code and treat it, together with the frozen test assets it names, as the primary execution queue for the stage.
- During coding, validate by invoking existing testcase entrypoints rather than rewriting them.
- When adding or refining supporting non-explicit tests in coding mode, keep the control point and observation point explicit in the test design and in any task summary.

## Test Semantics

### Explicit Testcases

- Explicit testcases are the stable acceptance or scenario baseline declared by intent architecture.
- Their target, scope, assertion boundary, and physical single entrypoint are not to be rewritten during ordinary coding.
- During implementation architecture design, the physical entry for each explicit testcase must be executable and should fail when the required implementation is still absent or incorrect; that expected failure is the intended signal handed to Coding/Repair.
- Every explicit testcase design must explicitly describe its control point and observation point. The control point is the trigger, input, setup, or executable entry that drives the behavior under test. The observation point is the externally observable output, state, artifact, log, error, or effect that the testcase asserts.
- If an explicit testcase is missing a physical entrypoint, report it as an implementation architecture design gap rather than patching around it silently in coding mode.

### Non-Explicit Tests

- Non-explicit tests belong to the implementation layer rather than the intent layer.
- During implementation architecture design, supporting and critical non-explicit tests that are needed to drive later coding should likewise be executable and may deliberately fail until the corresponding implementation is completed; do not convert missing implementation into placeholder passing assertions.
- Every non-explicit test design must also explicitly describe its control point and observation point; a testcase definition without both is incomplete.
- Critical non-explicit tests are limited to four categories:
  - architecture boundary guards
  - dependency direction guards
  - explicit entrypoint correctness guards
  - key implementation traceability guards
- Critical non-explicit tests should be frozen during implementation architecture design.
- Supporting non-explicit tests exist to help later coding and regression work and do not automatically become frozen contracts.
- Non-explicit tests should normally live in the owning stable element's `tests/` directory, with cross-directory tests owned by the nearest common ancestor.

## Control Loop Semantics

- Intent architecture design updates intent.
- Intent architecture design hands off through `design/KG/IntentToImplementationHandoff.json`.
- Implementation architecture design updates implementation contracts, testcase ownership, and executable expected-failing test assets that define the next coding target, then hands off through `design/KG/ImplementationToCodingHandoff.json`.
- Coding realizes implementation architecture by making those predesigned tests pass without redefining their acceptance boundary.
- Automated testing produces failure records that feed repair without redefining the upstream baselines.

## Architecture Design Principles

Apply these as active decision criteria, not as slogans:

- Clean Architecture
- SOLID Principles
- Deep Module
- Progressive Disclosure
- Separation of Concerns
- Stable dependency direction toward abstractions

When designing or changing implementation architecture:

- Prefer a small number of stable high-level elements over exhaustive mirrors of source files.
- Keep complex details behind stable module boundaries instead of leaking them to callers.
- Do not promote helpers, private functions, or incidental file splits into stable architecture elements without a real boundary reason.
- Ask the user only about high-leverage decisions that materially change module decomposition, interface boundaries, dependency direction, explicit entrypoint freezing, or critical guardrails.
- Derive implementation details directly from repository evidence, but never assume new architectural boundaries or intents without explicit graph or contract support.

## Expected Working Style

- Identify Your Stage: At the beginning of each task, explicitly state which stage you are operating in (Intent Design, Implementation Design, or Coding/Repair) based on the user's request and the files being modified.
- State clearly which conclusions are repository-confirmed facts and which are minimal assumptions.
- When editing architecture-related assets, prefer updating contracts and test guardrails before modifying business behavior unless the user explicitly asks for implementation work.
- If no contract file exists yet, report that as an architecture gap and create or update the appropriate contract file when the task is implementation architecture design.
- If you modify `design/KG/SystemArchitecture.json`, read `.github/argoschema/SystemArchitecture.schema.json` first, then run `npm run validate:system-architecture`, and do not finish until the JSON is structurally valid against that schema; schema violations or validator failures are blocking defects, not follow-up work.
- If you claim a stage is ready to hand off, validate the corresponding handoff artifact with `npm run validate:handoff:intent` or `npm run validate:handoff:implementation`; failing validation means the handoff is incomplete.
- **Stop and Ask**: If you find an unresolvable conflict between Intent (KG) and Implementation (Contracts) that would require a breaking change to the acceptance baseline, you must stop and present the conflict to the user instead of proceeding with assumptions.
- **Token Efficiency**: Aim for the most concise code implementation that satisfies all testcases. Avoid gold-plating or over-engineering that is not derived from the Intent Architecture.
- Do not reason from a single element name or one description field in isolation; use nearby relationships, views, upstream/downstream links, and referenced evidence before concluding how a concept should be implemented.


## Session Memory
### Current Stage
Implementation Design

### Targets
1. 先读取意图架构与现有实现架构证据，再设计稳定的实现架构边界、测试入口和测试护栏。
2. 把显性 testcase 视为契约，把当前代码仓视为实现现状证据，把实现架构契约视为需要直接落盘的设计产物。
3. 对于每条需要落地的显性 testcase，本阶段至少要完成关键断言落地：也就是把最小必要的断言骨架、断言边界、控制点和观测点物理化为可执行入口，而不是只写占位文件或只写路径约定。
4. 显性 testcase 的入口在本阶段完成后，必须能够被实际运行，并且在业务实现尚未补齐前允许且预期先以失败结果暴露缺口；这些“预期失败”的用例就是后续 Coding/Repair 阶段必须接手并修复到通过的工作清单。不要把显性 testcase 设计成在实现缺失时也能伪通过。
5. 这是 human in the loop 的实现架构设计任务：你必须先自行吸收仓库事实，再把真正会改变实现架构走向的高杠杆决策点提交给用户确认。

### Problems To Solve
1. 当前实现架构的一级分层和模块分解方式如何定义。
2. 关键接口边界与依赖方向如何冻结。
3. 哪些实现元素直接实现意图元素，哪些通过实现链间接承载意图元素。
4. 显性 testcase 的物理测试入口如何落位并保持只读验收基线，以及其关键断言如何在本阶段完成最小可执行落地。
5. 哪些关键非显性测试需要在本阶段冻结并物理化，哪些普通非显性测试只需作为后续编码阶段支撑护栏。

### User Decisions Required
   - 实现架构的一级分层和模块分解方式
   - 关键接口边界与依赖方向
   - 哪些实现元素用于直接实现意图元素，哪些通过实现链间接承载意图元素
   - 显性 testcase 的物理测试入口应如何落位并保持只读验收基线
   - 哪些关键非显性测试需要在本阶段冻结并物理化
   - 哪些普通非显性测试只需作为后续编码阶段的支撑护栏

### Operational Rules
1. 分析范围仅限当前工作区 d:\Projects\ThreatIntelliganceAgent。先读取意图架构，再读取已有实现架构契约（若存在），再按需读取代码、测试、脚本、配置与文档。凡是能从仓库和工具结果确认的事实，不要向用户追问。
2. 先读取 design/KG/IntentToImplementationHandoff.json；若该交接物缺失、格式不完整，或没有把显性 testcase、冻结基线、实现目标交代清楚，请先将其报告为上游阶段缺口，不要自行脑补补齐。
3. 本次产出必须直接落盘为代码仓中的实现架构本体：项目根目录下的 OVERALL_ARCHITECTURE.md、稳定实现元素目录下的 ARCHITECTURE.md、必要的目录/文件布局、显性测试入口、关键非显性测试与普通支撑测试护栏，以及 design/KG/ImplementationToCodingHandoff.json。
4. 本次产出的实现架构必须保持高层稳定边界，不要退化成源码镜像或函数级设计。
5. 对于意图架构中的显性 testcase，你除了建立追溯关系外，还必须为每条需要落地的显性 testcase 明确其单一测试入口如何物理化，使后续编码阶段可以“直接调用而不修改”。若仓库中尚不存在该入口，本阶段应负责设计并产出对应入口文件或明确其只读落点，而不是把这项责任下推给编码阶段。
6. 本阶段对显性 testcase 的最低交付标准不是“文件已存在”，而是“关键断言已落地并可执行”：至少要把核心断言口径、断言对象、控制点与观测点写入可运行入口，并避免只做空壳脚手架。
7. 显性 testcase 入口在本阶段完成后应被实际执行校验；若相关业务实现尚未完成，预期结果应是失败且失败原因可读。这类失败不是噪音，而是必须显式写入 design/KG/ImplementationToCodingHandoff.json 并交接给后续 /work 阶段的待修复输入，用来驱动 Coding/Repair 完成真实实现，而不是让测试入口虚假通过。
8. 在 handoff 或最终回复中，只要提到文件、契约、测试入口、夹具或基线，都必须写出具体仓库路径；不要使用“相关文件”“对应契约”“某个 ARCHITECTURE.md”这类模糊表述。若这些路径是给用户读取、检查、执行或交接使用的，请单独放进 ```text 代码块```，并保持一行一个路径，便于直接复制。
9. 所有测试用例设计都必须显性描述“控制点”和“观测点”。控制点是触发行为的入口、输入、前置布置或执行动作；观测点是被断言的外部可观察输出、状态、产物、日志、错误或副作用。无论是显性 testcase、关键非显性测试还是普通支撑测试，只要缺少控制点或观测点描述，都视为设计不完整，不能算交付完成。
10. 非显性测试必须分层处理：
   - 关键非显性测试只收口于四类：直接守架构边界、依赖方向、显性入口正确性、关键实现追溯
   - 关键非显性测试必须在本阶段定死并落盘其测试实现；/work 阶段不得修改其入口、断言边界、挂载对象、追溯关系、protected_fixtures 与 protected_baselines
   - 普通非显性测试作为编码阶段的支撑护栏输入，可以在后续编码阶段按契约允许的位置补充与优化
   - 非显性测试默认物理放在对应实现元素目录下的 tests/ 中；跨目录测试默认放在最近公共祖先目录下，并在相关 ARCHITECTURE.md 中回填归属
11. OVERALL_ARCHITECTURE.md 与 ARCHITECTURE.md 的契约格式必须统一采用共享骨架，但根契约与元素契约承担不同字段职责。根级总入口由 OVERALL_ARCHITECTURE.md 唯一承载；子目录局部契约默认由 ARCHITECTURE.md 承载。ARCHITECTURE.md 可以引用 OVERALL_ARCHITECTURE.md，但不得重复定义根级规则。
12. 按决策依赖顺序推进。先自己识别当前代码中的职责缠结、接口泄漏、shallow module 风险、不合理依赖方向以及实现承载缺口；然后只把真正高杠杆的架构决策提交给用户拍板。不要把可以通过仓库证据自己得出的结论丢给用户。
13. 除非用户明确要求，否则本次任务不要直接修改业务功能实现；重点是维护实现架构契约、显性 testcase 入口设计、关键非显性测试冻结与后续编码护栏，而不是直接进入业务编码。
14. 不要宣称本阶段可交接给 Coding/Repair，除非 design/KG/ImplementationToCodingHandoff.json 已写出并且 npm run validate:handoff:implementation 可以通过；若仍未通过，必须明确阻塞点。
